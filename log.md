# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the challange, posted about it on Twitter for accountability and I've considered the projects I want to work on over the next 100 days. It'll be May 12th by the time I finish this challange, so I will have handed in my dissertaiton and perhaps even completed my final exams. 

**Thoughts:** The projects I want to complete are: 

- Tidy up personal website (change it into a blog). 
- Make my Nasa APOD project
- Responsive data visualisation websites fetching some data from APIs,
- Complete some projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
- Build foundational cloud knowledge by completing some AWS/GCP tutorial projects.
- Write a web app for creating invocies (for my parent's business).

**Link to work:** [Personal Website](http://www.elliotalker.com) - My personal website is up, but I want to transform it into a Jekyll blog.
