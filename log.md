# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the challange, posted about it on Twitter for accountability and I've considered the projects I want to work on over the next 100 days. It'll be May 12th by the time I finish this challange, so I will have handed in my dissertaiton and perhaps even completed my final exams. 

**Thoughts:** The projects I could complete are: 

- Tidy up personal website (change it into a blog). 
- Make my Nasa APOD project
- Responsive data visualisation websites fetching some data from APIs.
- Build foundational cloud knowledge by completing some AWS/GCP tutorial projects.
- Write a web app for creating invocies (for my parent's business). [Starting Point](https://hackernoon.com/a-guide-to-creating-web-applications-with-react-and-redux-2f6bc0775951)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and (Leetcode)[https://leetcode.com/] problems on days when I don't want to work on my open projects.

Courses: I don't have to follow from beginning to end; these are some good starting points: 

- Complete some projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). 
- Follow along with [100 days of Swift UI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
- Build the solutions to the problems on [Project Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses).
- Complete some projects on [javascript30](https://javascript30.com/)



**Link to work:** [Personal Website](http://www.elliotalker.com) - My personal website is up, but I want to transform it into a Jekyll blog. 

### Day 1: February 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked from 15:30 - 17:30 on recreating a smaller project I made quite a while ago - a search webpage for NASA's APOD service. Their website is old and you can't search through the results 
efficiently, but the API is good. This was good practice for my JavaScript, and I used Bootstrap for the first time in years.

**Thoughts**: 

- Date pickers aren't a universally implemented feature on browsers (looking at you Safari). 
- Remember to put scripts before the closing `body` tag and not between the `head` tags. They will run before the web page has been rendered.
