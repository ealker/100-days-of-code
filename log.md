# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sunday February 2nd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the challange, posted about it on Twitter for accountability and I've considered the projects I want to work on over the next 100 days. It'll be May 12th by the time I finish this challange, so I will have handed in my dissertaiton and perhaps even completed my final exams. 

**Thoughts:** The projects I could complete are: 

- Tidy up personal website (change it into a blog). 
- Make my Nasa APOD project
- Responsive data visualisation websites fetching some data from APIs.
- Build foundational cloud knowledge by completing some AWS/GCP tutorial projects.
- Write a web app for creating invocies (for my parent's business). [Starting Point](https://hackernoon.com/a-guide-to-creating-web-applications-with-react-and-redux-2f6bc0775951)
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and (Leetcode)[https://leetcode.com/] problems on days when I don't want to work on my open projects.

Courses: I don't have to follow from beginning to end; these are some good starting points: 

- Complete some projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). 
- Follow along with [100 days of Swift UI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
- Build the solutions to the problems on [Project Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses).
- Complete some projects on [javascript30](https://javascript30.com/)



**Link to work:** [Personal Website](http://www.elliotalker.com) - My personal website is up, but I want to transform it into a Jekyll blog. 

### Day 1: Monday February 3rd, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked from 15:30 - 17:30 on recreating a smaller project I made quite a while ago - a search webpage for NASA's APOD service. Their website is old and you can't search through the results 
efficiently, but the API is good. This was good practice for my JavaScript, and I used Bootstrap for the first time in years.

**Thoughts**: 

- Date pickers aren't a universally implemented feature on browsers (looking at you Safari). 
- Remember to put scripts before the closing `body` tag and not between the `head` tags. They will run before the web page has been rendered. 

### Day 2: Tuesday February 4th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I continued my work on the Nasa APOD search tool today - rather than inputting the date with a 
text form (as I did in my original project), I decided to use a date picker. As I learned yesterday, the HTML5 `date` type
doesn't work on all browers (mainly those using web kit); I could either use a text box (but would then have to sanatise input)
or I could use a JQuery datepicker - since I wanted to have more experience with JQuery, I decided to go for this option. I found a tutorial for using a [bootstrap datepicker](https://formden.com/blog/date-picker).

**Thoughts**: 

- JQuery won't work if the text encoding of the page is incorrect. I explored some answers on StackOverflow and 
read [Joel Spolsky's Blog](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/).

### Day 3:  Wednesday February 5th 2020, 

***Today's Progress**: I had a lot of dissertation work to complete today, so my coding time this evening was spent working on my unviersity profile site and blog. I've also been looking at improving my skills in responsive web design, so tomorrow I will try and work on a CSS Grid Gallery. 

***Thoughts***: 

- Like exercise, it's useful to "get it out of the way" when coding on days when there are a million other things to do. Some days I can sit down and work on a problem for hours, on other days though, life gets in the way.
